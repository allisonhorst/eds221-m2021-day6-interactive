## Practice:

```{r}
animals <- c("brown bear", "red bird", "yellow duck", "blue horse")
for (i in 1:(length(animals) - 1)){
print(paste(animals[i], animals[i], "what do you see? I see a", animals[i+1],"looking at me."))
}
```

### Tidy Data! 

Using tidyr in the tidyverse package:

-pivot_longer: if values are showing up as column names. this gathers variables spread over multiple columns and melts them into one column

-pivot_wider: spreads columns when there are multiple variables in one column

```{r}
#Structure:
#  tidyr::pivot_longer(data, range of columns, names_to = what we are calling the new column, values_to = where we want to put the values aka what we want to call that column)
#  tidyr::pivot_longer(data, names_from = where are the names of the new columns coming from, values_to = what column are the values in)
```

-tidyr::separate() separates elements in a single column into multiple columns

```{r}
#Structure:
# separate(data, col = column of values I need to separate into multiple columns, into = what the new names are that I want as columns, sep = the character to look for that defines the separation)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```
